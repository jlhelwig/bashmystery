The way we found the answer. We used GREP to search for the CLUES that gave us the key points. The guys height, his membership cards, and the name of the witness Annabel.
From People we found four Annabels, two matched the description. From the description we found the address using Head, which gave us the interview #.... from the interview number we found that we found that it was a Blue Honda with a certain license plate number. From there we found all of the blue Honda's that matched the description and narrowed down suspects to two candidates Joe Germuska and Jeremy Bowers...We checked memberships against Joe and Jerey and only Jeremy had memberships to all of the groups from the wallet cards.
